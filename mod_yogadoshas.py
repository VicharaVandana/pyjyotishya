This presents a condition in the kundali of a person where the negatives add up to a positive outcome that can be life-altering. Fortunes are reversed wherein you receive benefits after a spate of bad luck.
        Vipreeta Raja Yoga is a contradictory yoga where you get the positive results from the paapi grahas. These grahas are notorious for causing malice and ill-will with their effects. But they face an advantageous position when they are in each other's houses and this results in positive outcomes.
        According to Phaladeepika, The native with Vimala yoga will be clever in saving money, frugal in his expenses, equipped with good behavior towards others, will enjoy happiness, will be independent, will follow a respectable profession or conduct, and will be well known for his good qualities.
        The native with Vimala yoga will be good at accumulating wealth, good in financial management, spend less, enjoy the pleasures, he also charitable in nature, will be famous in the circle. On the other side, he will also spend on hospitalization, hostile to learned people, will get into unnecessary arguments, short-lived. This yoga also blesses the person with a positive attitude, an honourable career and a spiritual approach to life.
